### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Who am I?
I'd like to describe myself by these three sentences; A self-motivated person who is open minded about science, thirsty to
learn new things, and eager to face new challenges. 
It is hard for me to say which programming languages I do prefer! but if I had three choices, I go for Javascript, Python and Go, respectively.
