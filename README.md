### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
WHo am I?
I would like to describe myself by this three sentences; A self-motivated person who is open minded about science, thirsty to
learn new things, and eager to face new challenges. 
It is hard for me to say which programming language I do prefer! but if I had three choices, I go for Javascript, Python and Java, respectively.
